The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning sea. For fifty years, he'd watched the waves crash against the rocks, a lonely sentinel against the storm. Tonight, though, something was different. A phosphorescent glow pulsed beneath the waves, drawing closer. Silas gripped the railing, his heart pounding a rhythm against his ribs older than the lighthouse itself. The glow intensified, rising from the depths. A colossal eye, the size of a ship's sail, broke the surface, staring at him with ancient wisdom. Silas didn't scream. He simply nodded, a silent greeting to the leviathan, before the eye blinked and sank back into the inky black, leaving him alone once more with the storm.
