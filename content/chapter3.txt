The clockmaker, a wizened man with eyes that held the secrets of centuries, meticulously placed the final gear. This wasn't just any clock; it was a timepiece designed to rewind a single moment. He'd poured his life, his grief, into its creation. With trembling hands, he wound the delicate mechanism. The gears whirred, the hands spun backward. The room shimmered. He saw her again, his beloved wife, standing in the doorway, her smile radiant. He reached for her, but the clock shuddered, the gears grinding to a halt. The vision vanished, leaving him with the crushing weight of time's relentless march and a broken clock, a monument to his shattered hope.
