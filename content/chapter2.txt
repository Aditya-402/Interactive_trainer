Elara traced the faded inscription on the weathered tombstone. "Beloved Companion." A single, crimson rose lay at its base, a splash of vibrant color against the grey stone. A low growl rumbled from the shadows. Elara didn't flinch. A massive, black wolf emerged, its eyes reflecting the setting sun like twin embers. It nudged her hand with its wet nose, a silent plea for affection. Elara knelt, burying her fingers in its thick fur. "He misses you too, Shadow," she whispered, tears blurring her vision. The wolf whined softly, resting its head on her lap, a silent testament to a love that transcended even death.
