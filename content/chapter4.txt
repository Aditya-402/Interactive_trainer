Amelia held the seashell to her ear, listening to the whispers of the ocean trapped within. It wasn't the usual roar of the waves she heard, but a faint, melodic hum. She closed her eyes, letting the sound wash over her. Suddenly, she was standing on a moonlit beach, the sand cool beneath her bare feet. A figure emerged from the mist, tall and ethereal, with eyes like the deep sea. He extended a hand, his touch sending shivers down her spine. "Come," he whispered, his voice like the tide pulling her in. Amelia opened her eyes. The shell was silent, the beach empty, but the memory of his touch lingered, a promise of a world beyond the waves.
